# Sip & Savor Builder
- This application was developed to help the user come up with a random combination of food and drinks.  
- The motivation for this project was that when the user doesn't know what to eat or drink you can generate a random combination on the spot.  
- The user can also look back on the past 5 generated combinations if they wish with no trouble.
## How To Use
- To use the website all you need to do is press the generate button on the screen and a combination will display.
- If the user wants to look at the history all you need to do is look under the history button and it will be displayed on the screen.
